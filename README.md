<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> </head> <body> <div class="letter"> <h2>Dear Kira,</h2> <p> You are not a fleeting dream. You are not a passing season. You are the story I wish to tell until the end of my days.<br><br> I do not love you because of what the world sees; I love you for the infinite universe that lives within you — for your laughter, which heals; for your kindness, which teaches; for your presence, which steadies.<br><br> With you, even silence is music, even stillness is poetry. This love is not shallow; it is an ocean. Its tides rise with every heartbeat, and even when the surface is still, beneath it lives a depth that no storm can shake.<br><br> I promise you this: I will not only love you on the easy days, when the skies are clear and the air is sweet. I will love you in the storms, when thunder shakes the ground and shadows fall. I will hold your hand when it trembles, and lift your head when it bows. I will remind you of your strength when you forget, and of your light when the world feels dim.<br><br> My love is not fragile. It is not a candle that flickers in the wind. It is a fire carved into stone, a vow written into the marrow of my being, an eternity carried in every heartbeat.<br><br> Beyond words and beyond the small measures of time we keep, I give you this: a life of patient tending, of faithful mornings and steady nights, of laughter offered freely and refuge given without question. I will learn the maps of your heart so I can find you when the roads grow confusing; I will collect the broken pieces of our hard days and sew them with care until they are whole again. 
  When the world asks for proof, I will show up — not with grand declarations for a single hour, but with quiet, unending acts that say, again and again, you are seen, you are chosen, you are loved.<br><br> Let the seasons come and go and let the shapes of our lives change; I will remain — a constant hand, a willing shoulder, a voice that remembers your name even when you cannot.
  This is my promise: to be here, fully and without reservation, for every small ordinary miracle and every fierce storm, for every becoming you are and every rest you need — always, always beside you. 
 <br> And if forever should stretch beyond the years we are given, know that my love will not end at the boundaries of time. It will live in every echo of your laughter, in the quiet corners of the world we touched together, in the gentle rhythm of memories that refuse to fade. My devotion is not confined to this moment, nor to this lifetime — it is an inheritance I leave to the universe, a story written in the stars, a prayer whispered into eternity.

You are not simply the love of my life; you are the axis upon which my world turns, the sacred constant in the chaos of all else. With you, I have learned that love is not just a feeling but a sanctuary, a place to rest when the world grows cold, a fire to warm the soul when everything else is dark. You are that fire, and I vow never to let its light falter.

And so I give you not only the words of my heart but the hours of my days, the strength of my hands, the tenderness of my care. I give you my silence when you need peace, and my voice when you need encouragement. I give you the certainty that no matter how heavy the weight of life may become, you will never have to carry it alone.

If the world should ever doubt us, let them look at the way I hold you — not with desperation, but with reverence; not as though you are mine to possess, but as though you are a wonder entrusted to me, a miracle to cherish. And in every tomorrow, in every uncertain dawn, I will choose you again — willingly, joyfully, endlessly. </p> <div class="signature"> Forever yours,<br> Samia </div> </div> </body> </html>
