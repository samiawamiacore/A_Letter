<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> </head> <body> <div class="letter"> <h2>Dear Kira,</h2> <p> You are not a fleeting dream. You are not a passing season. You are the story I wish to tell until the end of my days.<br><br> I do not love you because of what the world sees; I love you for the infinite universe that lives within you — for your laughter, which heals wounds I never spoke of; for your kindness, which teaches me to be softer with the world; for your presence, which steadies me when the storms rise.<br><br> You are my compass, my anchor, my wings. With you, I am both grounded and free. With you, even silence is music, even stillness is poetry. This love is not shallow; it is an ocean. Its tides rise with every heartbeat, and even when the surface is still, beneath it lives a depth that no storm can shake.<br><br> I promise you this: I will not only love you on the easy days, when the skies are clear and the air is sweet. I will love you in the storms, when thunder shakes the ground and shadows fall. I will hold your hand when it trembles, and lift your head when it bows. I will remind you of your strength when you forget, and of your light when the world feels dim.<br><br> My love is not fragile. It is not a candle that flickers in the wind. It is a fire carved into stone, a vow written into the marrow of my being, an eternity carried in every heartbeat.<br><br> Beyond words and beyond the small measures of time we keep, I give you this: a life of patient tending, of faithful mornings and steady nights, of laughter offered freely and refuge given without question. I will learn the maps of your heart so I can find you when the roads grow confusing; I will collect the broken pieces of our hard days and sew them with care until they are whole again. When the world asks for proof, I will show up — not with grand declarations for a single hour, but with quiet, unending acts that say, again and again, you are seen, you are chosen, you are loved.<br><br> Let the seasons come and go and let the shapes of our lives change; I will remain — a constant hand, a willing shoulder, a voice that remembers your name even when you cannot. If someday our steps slow or our hair turns silver, I will still recognize the same light in your eyes that first called me home. This is my promise: to be here, fully and without reservation, for every small ordinary miracle and every fierce storm, for every becoming you are and every rest you need — always, always beside you. </p> <div class="signature"> Forever yours,<br> Samia </div> </div> </body> </html>
